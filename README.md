Twitter World Mood
==================

This is a command line utility that responds with the world mood based on the [Arduino Twitter Mood Light](http://www.instructables.com/id/Twitter-Mood-Light-The-Worlds-Mood-in-a-Box/). Type in `worldmood.py` and you'll get back in response something like `The world is feeling slightly happy, but mostly excited`, or `The world is feeling equally excited and sad`. It's still in very early development (I haven't written any code yet). This is my first command line utility, so it might not be completely bug-free.
